### What do we do?

Sign language is a way of communicating using hand gestures, movements and facial expressions, instead of spoken words. It is the medium of communication used by non-verbal people to exchange information amongst their own community and with verbal people. In order to bridge the communication gap between people with hearing and speaking disabilities and people who do not use sign language, we at MetaGesture have developed an AI-enabled system that will translate sign language to written English text. The system is based on a Deep Learning-based model trained with a large volume of hand gesture images of ASL and their corresponding translations. In addition to translation capabilities, we also provide an emergency communication feature which enables you to send a message to concerned authorities (local police) in case of emergencies.
